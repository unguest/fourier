## About the samples

This repo contains several live malware samples (+ PETools) for demonstration purposes only. I am not responsible of any damage done to any computer with these. You are the only person responsible of any misuse.

## To Do

- [ ] Enrich WinAPI data and update automatically from malapi.io
- [ ] Create a real analysis engine
- [ ] Create a reporting system
- [ ] Golden ticket : autogenerate PDFs
- [ ] Enhance performances by keeping information about the PE in the main loop instead of computing it each time (creation of a structure)
